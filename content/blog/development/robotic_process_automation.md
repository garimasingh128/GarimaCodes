## Introduction 🧠

During business uncertainty, you want to get the most out of every opportunity. Robotic process automation (RPA) is designed to handle those repetitive, routine, dreary and uninteresting tasks found inside most business processes. Keeping those going enables you to process information 24 hours a day, seven days a week without people intervention. 

With RPA, employees can focus on higher level tasks requiring reasoning and customer interaction. Increase your productivity, build more efficient operations and a better experience for employees and customers.

> Robotic Process Automation has 3 terms in it and here we have each term explained:

> Robotic: An entity which has the capability to mimic the human actions.

> Process: A sequence of steps, that lead to meaningful activity or task is known as a process.

> Automation: Tasks happen automatically i.e. without human intervention.

## What is RPA? 🙄

The process of automating business operations with the help of robots to reduce human intervention is said to be Robotic Process Intervention or simply RPA.

## Phases of RPA 🔤

RPA is implemented in 4 phases:

1. Planning
2. Development
3. Testing
4. Support and Maintenance

RPA is not about creating a humanoid robot nor it is there to replace humans. 

## How does RPA works? ⛑️

This question might be bothering you whether physical robots are used or actual automation tools are used for doing the task. RPA, actually consists of a few softwares available in the market which let you configure automation and work close to automate your business operations. RPA robots are capable of mimicking many–if not all–human user actions. They log into applications, move files and folders, copy and paste data, fill in forms, extract structured and semi-structured data from documents, scrape browsers, and more.

## Some real-life examples ⁉️

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563207153-f403bf289096?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ)

Lets take an example. **Suppose we want to automate "movie search" using a Robot.** Lets take a scenario in which a person wants to search for a particular movie he wants to watch. He searches in multiple websites but could not find his movie. After multiple failed attempts, he gets disappointed. He realises that he wasted a lot of time in searching a movie. Now he decides to use the power of RPA. 

He creates a Robot that searches all the major websites for the given movie. Here, the term 'robot' is not actually a physical machine or what you see in movies. It's actually a software that runs on a virtual or a physical machine. 

So after the task of searching the movie is performed by the robot, after few hours he gets the notification that the movie is found. 

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1485827404703-89b55fcc595e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ)

> There are 6 major steps that the bot has performed:

1. Open website.
2. Search for a movie.
3. Find the results.
4. Save the results.
5. Repeat same with other websites.
6. Lastly, the most important step i.e. to send the collated message to the user. 

In this way, RPA bots are capable of mimicking most human-computer interactions to carry out a ton of error-free tasks at high volume and speed. Now, in this automated process, the work is reduced for the human and saves time and energy both by using RPA robots.

Lets take another example. **Think of copy-paste tasks and moving files from one location to another.** To perform these tasks in bulk with a high speed, RPA bots are your perfect friend.

## RPA Tools ⛏️

RPA is implemented through softwares. These can be considered as RPA tools. 

Here are some top tools in RPA market that help you to automate tasks easily.

1. UiPath
2. Blue Prism
3. Automation anywhere

These 3 tools are most widely used in the automation industry for various purposes.

## RPA Benefits 🖼️

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507146153580-69a1fe6d8aa1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ)

### Accuracy

- Less error prone
- High uniformity
- High precision

### Consistency - All repetitive tasks are performed with the same accuracy and speed

- Reduced cost of process execution
- Increased productivity
- Improved output accuracy
- Easier scaling

## **How is RPA different from other enterprise automation tools?** 💫

In contrast to other, traditional IT solutions, RPA allows organizations to automate at a fraction of the cost and time previously encountered. RPA is also non-intrusive in nature and leverages the existing infrastructure without causing disruption to underlying systems, which would be difficult and costly to replace. With RPA, cost efficiency and compliance are no longer an operating cost but a byproduct of the automation.

## Myths that exist about RPA 🇧🇱

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495055154266-57bbdeada43e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ)

### Myth 1: Coding is required to use RPA software.

That's not true at all. To use RPA and implement it, one needs to understand how its tools and the softwares work on the front-end. So even if a non-technical person wants to create a RPA Robot, he can easily do it given he has a basic knowledge of softwares and their front-end. 

### Myth 2: RPA Software does not require human supervison.

This is a complete illusion because humans are needed to program the RPA bots, feed them tasks for automation and manage them. So, humans are not replaced by robots in either way.

### Myth 3: Only large big companies can afford to deploy RPA.

Even small to medium sized companies and organisations can deploy RPA and automate their businesses.

## Applications of RPA 🎡

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c46668fb-911f-48bd-a2cf-a572e60b0410/download.png)

Multinational companies like Deloitte, Accenture, and much more use RPA in their day-to-day tasks. 

> So, these are the various sectors where RPA is used.

1. Customer service
2. Human Resource
3. Accounting
4. Financial services
5. Supply chain management
6. Healthcare

RPA is a technology that'll make your work easy and is quite reliable to use. It's something to worth investing on as an organisation.

## **What are the pitfalls of RPA?** 🤖

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563209259-2819dbb22d93?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ)

RPA isn’t for every enterprise. As with any automation technology, RPA has the potential to eliminate jobs, which presents CIOs with challenges managing talent. While enterprises embracing RPA are attempting to transition many workers to new jobs, Forrester Research estimates that RPA software will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or more knowledge workers, or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce.

Even if CIOs navigate the human capital conundrum, RPA implementations [fail more often than not](https://www.cio.com/article/3226387/artificial-intelligence/why-rpa-implementations-fail.html). “Several robotics programs have been put on hold, or CIOs have flatly refused to install new bots,” Alex Edlich and Vik Sohoni, senior partners at McKinsey & Company, said [in a May 2017 report](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/digital-blog/burned-by-the-bots-why-robotic-automation-is-stumbling).

Installing thousands of bots has taken a lot longer and is more complex and costly than most organizations have hoped it would be, Edlich and Sohoni say. The platforms on which bots interact often change, and the necessary flexibility isn’t always configured into the bot. Moreover, a new regulation requiring minor changes to an application form could throw off months of work in the back office on a bot that’s nearing completion.

## Closing and Summary 🌤️ 🤨

- Robotic Process Automation allows organisations to automate task just like a human being was doing them across application and systems.
- The main goal of RPA is to replace repetitive and boring clerical tasks performed by hu,ams, with a virtual workforce.
- More CIOS are turning to robotic process automation to eliminate tedious tasks, freeing corporate workers to focus on higher value work. But RPA requires proper design, planning and governance if it's to bolster the business, experts say.
- RPA is used in wide range of industries like Healthcare, Insurance, Banking, IT etc.

## Call-to-Action 📕

> Memory is the diary we carry around with us.
> -Oscar Wilde

## LET'S START WITH 'WHAT IS MEMORY'?✍

The term 'memory' is used to refer to the mental faculty of retaining and recalling past experience. An act of memory is the action of calling upon or collecting facts learned earlier, all over again, to produce the required information at the appropriate time.

Memorizing something comes with 3 (not so) simple steps -

- Retaining information
- Storing information
- Recalling information

The good news is that memory is not an absolute ability you're born with. Our brain is a machine learning model which applies reinforcement learning to itself. It can be trained with adequate practice and use.

Research has shown that students who studied with the help of memory devices or scientifically endorsed techniques retained more of the matter they had learnt. Some of these are discussed below.

## MEMORY IN THE TIME OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD ✌

In these days of constantly exploding information technology, we are all willy-nilly exposed to more information than we have the power to process. It is virtually impossible to avoid knowledge of what is happening in the world around, even if you don't really want to know.

Every day, we're bombarded with tonnes of information. To process it efficiently, it's important to compartmentalize it and get rid of the unwanted. Your brain is like your cupboard. The cleaner it is, the easier it is to find useful information. An uncluttered mind would be able to store important information in an efficient and effective manner and retrieve it quickly when required.

### HOW CAN I DEAL WITH INFORMATION OVERLOAD? ✅

Start by reducing the load of trivia in your brain. A lot of information need not be stored in your memory because you can store it elsewhere for use. You have to realize that our brains, no matter how efficient, are still finite resources. They have limits to what they can store and process. There are no such limits on external storage, however, so you must take advantage of that.

Build yourself a second brain, as Tiago Forte puts it.

### EASY DOs ✅

Jotting down important information at a single place, carrying a small diary for reminders; these are a few immediate fixes. However, you can take it a step further and create a digital, universal notebook of sorts for all your data.

For managing tasks, you can use simple to-do list apps like these:

1. To Do List
2. Google Tasks
3. Any.do
4. Microsoft To Do
5. Or you can make one yourself if you're a developer.😉

If you're already comfortable with to-do lists and want to take this a step further, you must invest in a good note-taking app that can serve as a second brain. Some of the best ones out there are:

1. Notion

   [Notion - The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://www.notion.so)

2. Roam Research

## ENCODING INFORMATION ⚙

Effective encoding is the result of a conscious and deliberate exercise. It consists of processing what you read, see or hear. Your mind needs to work on what you read in the way that digestive system needs to work on the food you eat. Encoding is an active process and requires selective attention to the material to be encoded.

> INTEREST → ATTENTION → ENCODING

Attention and interest are interlinked. Over time, deliberate and voluntary efforts at evoking interest and attention will give way to free, spontaneous and involuntary attention.

Some are born with a good memory, some simply acquire it.

How?

By following the 3 golden rules of learning:

- Think about what you read.
- Question what you read.
- Make notes as you read.

## HOW CAN I INCREASE MY ATTENTION SPAN? 🤯

Meditation is a time tested method of practicing to direct thought in the desired direction and train perceptive skills. Control strong feelings and try to achieve mental calm. Sudden distractions can impair your ability to concentrate so try to avoid them as far as possible.

Some people are blessed with a _'photographic memory'_. An exceptionally rare gift, but those without the gift need not despair. You just need to use your inner eye as a camera and your mind as a mental notice board. Random connection between things triggers off a chain of associations that give rise to memories without too much effort.

Well-known psychologists have shown through their studies that within one or two days we forget about 80% of what we have learnt. At the end of an hour of learning, your mind integrates the information that you have just studied. Your ability to recall it actually rises after about ten minutes and then falls of dramatically. Therefore what you need to do is review what you have learnt at that 10-minute mark. Reinforce the information when it is at its strongest in your mind.

## FIRST HAND LEARNING?⚡

According to Wikipedia, Firsthand learning is an inquiry process that is generative of questions that focus subsequent investigations. The process invites learners to gather and record their observations, to analyze and interpret them, and to arrive at provisional answers.

Arising from a learner's innate curiosity and the desire to investigate real phenomena, firsthand learning empowers people by providing them with opportunities to figure things out for themselves, to believe in the analytical abilities of their own minds, and to connect with the world around them. It requires close engagement with the immediate environment.

Substitute experiences have been classified and created by educationists according to their relative effectiveness.

- The most popular but the least effective are words or verbal symbols.
- Visual symbols like diagrams charts and maps are less abstract and more effective as they explain the relationship between objects symbolically. A picture is worth a thousand words, as the old saying goes.
- The most effective substitute would involve TV as there is a combination of visual and oral experiences combined with the sense of life in motion.

According to researchers [Dr. L.D. Rosenblum](http://www.amazon.com/See-What-Im-Saying-Extraordinary/dp/0393067602), Dr. Harold Stolovitch and Dr Erica Keeps, here’s how much information each of our senses processes at the same time as compared to our other senses.

- 83.0% – Sight
- 11.0% – Hearing
- 03.5% – Smell
- 01.5% – Touch
- 01.0% – Taste

[Your Senses Are Your Raw Information Learning Portals](https://velvetchainsaw.com/2012/05/23/your-senses-your-raw-information-learning-portals/)

The best way to learn is undoubtedly through first-hand experience. For example, the best way to learn about life in a village is to actually go to one.

It is because first-hand learning is the most effective form, so much so that schools and colleges put a lot of emphasis on project work, exhibitions, or field-work. They allow you to think about the information you are getting in order to analyze it and present it systematically for other people to understand.

So don't underestimate the importance of first-hand learning.

## TRAINING YOUR SENSES✔

Is it possible to be conscious of everything that is happening around us? Most of the time, we are only weakly aware of what is going on. That is because all our sensory organs are working simultaneously in a passive state.
One industry which places a lot of attention to the way that people retain information is the advertising industry as of course the whole point of advertising is to make consumers remember a certain product.

### SPECIFIC MEMORY TOOLS🛠

One easy way to train your power of observation is by trying to remember the names of all the people you meet. Take visual cues, store little details about them in your head that you normally wouldn't. When you think back on these details, it will be easy to recall the person. This technique works as continuous memory training and helps you to improve your capacity to take in details.

## TESTS AND EXAMS🚴‍♀️

Recall is better when tested in the same physical or emotional context as in which the process of learning took place. This means that retention is difficult when the cues present at the time of learning are not present at the time of recall. Sometimes we cannot remember something which, at other times, we can recall pretty easily. This kind of forgetfulness is fortunately temporary.

For example, the stress of the exam situation or the unfamiliarity of the exam room can sometimes cause unnecessary distress to the brain and hinder our ability to recall needed information. Sometimes, you might just have a mental block. You have to learn to relax during exams and to believe in yourself.

## WHY DO WE FORGET?😵

Retrieval of a memory is not a random process. It is basically a reconstruction of the past activity of encoding. The brain, like other organs, is similar to a machine that needs to be used in the right manner.

The first reason why we forget is usually because _encoding or learning was not a pleasant experience and therefore it was not effective_. It may seem hard to make every learning experience a positive or enjoyable one, but the key is to have a positive attitude and an enthusiastic, inquisitive mind that can make even the toughest topics seem interesting.

## FINALLY, A GOLDEN RULE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE STICK TO😎

Update your mind cache with _Fibonacci Sequence Interval_, starting from index = 2.

- Suppose you solved a problem on Day 0.
- Solve the same problem after a gap as per Fibonacci Sequence starting from 1,2,3,5....
- Only STOP when you are able to solve the problem for three consecutive days and the third day should be a cakewalk.

> It's not about how many problems you've solved, it's about how well you remember and have understood the ones you already know.

In order to recall what you have learnt and to recall it whenever you want, the information has to be transferred from short term memory to long term memory. This requires conscious effort.

---

## FREE MOTIVATION🎁

Only you can make a difference. Your learning ability depends on your maturity and physical and psychological readiness. As long as you remain motivated, you will learn well and recall information easily. If you do not want to learn, no one can make you. When you are willing to learn, no one can stop you. You need to be an active participant for the learning process to be most effective.

Motivation is as important as setting yourself positive goals. So reward yourself appropriately after each accomplishment.
