Insurance cost prediction using linear regression.

![](./images/pic3.png)

In this assignment weâ€™re going to use information like a personâ€™s age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
We will create a model with the following steps: 1. Download and explore the dataset 2. Prepare the dataset for training 3. Create a linear regression model 4. Train the model to fit the data 5. Make predictions using the trained model
This assignment builds upon the concepts from the first 2 lectures. It will help to review these Jupyter notebooks:
